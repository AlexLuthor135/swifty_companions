Swifty Companion is a **React Native mobile application** that allows you to **search and view 42 school students' profiles**.

The app connects to the **42 API** using OAuth2 authentication and presents cleanly organized information about each student, including their personal details, cursus progress, skills, and finished projects.

---

## ✨ Main Features

- 🔍 **Search students** by login.
- 👤 **Display profile details**: display name, login, email, wallet, correction points.
- 🎓 **List all cursus** the student is enrolled in.
- 📈 **Show student's overall level** for each cursus.
- 🛠️ **Display skills** with levels and animated progress bars.
- 📚 **List completed projects** with pass/fail validation.
- 🔒 **Manage OAuth2 tokens** smartly: cache tokens, refresh before expiration, and auto-retry on token errors.
- 📱 **Responsive and clean design** for mobile screens.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### In case of errors with @env, run this command:

## 🔧 Environment Variables

You need to create a `.env` file at the root of the project, as in `.env_example`.

Also, you need to creat an APP on intra. The redirect URL must be `myapp://oauth-callback`.

Here are the required environment variables:

| Variable Name | Description                              | Example                         |
|:--------------|:-----------------------------------------|:--------------------------------|
| `API_UID`     | Your 42 API application UID (client ID)  | `ab12c34d567890abcdef1234567890` |
| `API_SECRET`  | Your 42 API application secret           | `1a2b3c4d5e6f7g8h9i0j1k2l3m4n5o6p` |
| `API_URL`     | Base URL of the 42 API                   | `https://api.intra.42.fr` |

### Example `.env` file:

```dotenv
API_UID=your_api_uid_here
API_SECRET=your_api_secret_here
API_URL=https://api.intra.42.fr
